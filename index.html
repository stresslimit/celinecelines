      <p class="title-xs">“We are encouraging designers to use waste as a material,” she said. But she said she saw opportunity in other models, like design for disassembly, which involves breaking down unsold clothing to make new garments rather than burning them. Forcing the industry to use what it has, said Ms. Semaan, would give farming and fossil fuels a break. — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/07/business/dealbook/fashion-profitable-growth.html">The New York Times</a></p>
